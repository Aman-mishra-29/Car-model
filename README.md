This is a small Machine Learning project on "Car Price Prediction" based on their models and their accessories and parts of the cars.  

In this model we will enter some basic component details like material used to build the car body, engine type, fuel type, wheels, seating capacity, length width height of car, seat cover material, etc. to train the model

For test the model we will use data like engine type, rpm, power generated, wheels size, body dimensions, etc.
