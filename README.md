This is a small Machine Learning project on "Car Price Prediction" based on their models and their accessories and parts of the cars.  

In this model we will enter some basic component details like engine type, fuel type, wheelbase, length & width of car, etc. to train the model

For test the model we will use data like engine type, rpm, power generated, wheels size, body dimensions, etc.
